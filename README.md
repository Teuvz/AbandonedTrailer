## What is this ?
On Friday, August 13th 2021, Blue Box Game Studios released the "Realtime Experience" app for their recently announced game Abandoned. The hype was huge since it had already been pushed back several times and so thousands of people -including me- rushed to download the update.  
  
Turns out it was just 7 seconds of some legs walking.  
  
Trying to relax after that discovery, I wondered: how long would it take me to create the same thing? Blue Box, a team of 10 to 20 people, with the help of (apparently) 7 outside studios, took over two months to create this. I estimated it would take me two to three hours.  
  
Turns out it took me three and a half hours.  
You can see the whole creation process [on youtube](https://youtu.be/gQX4LcBp0y8).

## What's the point ?
The point was to check how long it would take me, a simple web programer, to recreate that teaser.  
This experiment proves that the amount of work put into this teaser by a professional game studio is less than minimal.

## Where can I see it run ?
You can find a Windows installation exe and an HTML5 version on https://matthewpcharlton.com/games/AbandonedTrailer

## What can I do with it ?
Do whatever you want, it's a free world dude.
